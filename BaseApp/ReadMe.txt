I wanted to do the mobile app, #3. I spent most of the weekend tinkering with my Macbook to try and get the software running, but my everything was out of date. My Macbook is too old to run OS X Yosemite, so I had to settle with trying to find a copy of Mountain Lion, so I could get XCode 5, since my XCode 3 wouldn't work with Cordova.

I think OS X Mountain Lion is still downloading.

I changed gears Monday afternoon when I realized I wouldn't be able to do the mobile app.

The Datasource is MySQL and you can generate the schema from the .sql file in the main directory. It's a php site I build on Wamp with the Yii Framework and Highcharts.
